The speech recognition system that this team is developing has been implemented and trained
entirely autonomously. This is an application for machine learning that is highly advantageous.
The rigorous programming of each word can be done accurately and rapidly using certain
machine learning techniques. This method also has the added advantage of being able to add
certain levels complexity by simply tweaking the algorithm instead of doubling the work. One
of these areas can be seen when adding multiple voices to the same word. Instead of
reprogramming a whole system for the new voice the new voice is simply input into the system
and trained with these new values.


There are three parts to the implementation of this system. First are the feature extraction
protocols. Second is the actual input of these featureâ€™ s into the neural network. The third and
final step is implementing this system on some sort of hardware system. In the feature
extraction portion machine learning techniques are not implemented but the methods used in
this part are very important since stronger and more accurate feature extraction protocols
allows for a more accurate result predicted by the neural network. This is equivalent to saying
that when someone speaks clearer they can be better understood. These features are then
placed as inputs to a deep neural network and this neural network goes through an iterative
teaching protocol to understand the words given to it. The algorithms that are researched are
specifically chosen for our use case. These use cases include but are not limited to the level of
complexity as it stands with the actual words that we are trying to predict. Also, another thing
to consider is the hardware that is available to implement the system.
